1. Difference between throw and throws.
    Throw is a keyword which is used to throw an exception explicitly in the program inside a function or inside a block of code. 
    Throws is a keyword used in the method signature used to declare an exception which might get thrown by the function while executing the code.
    Only single exception is thrown by using throw.
    Multiple exceptions can be thrown by using throws.

2. What are the exceptions you have faced
   (how can you resolve no such element exception)
        (1) WebDriverException
        (2) NoSuchElementException
        (3) NoSuchFrameException
        (4) NoAlertPresentException
        (5) NoSuchWindowException
        (6) ElementNotVisibleException
        (7) ElementNotInterceptableException
        (8) SessionNotCreatedException
        (9) TimeOutException
        (10) InvalidSelectorException
        (11) IllegalStateException
        (12) StaleElementReferenceException

        1. NoSuchElementException occurs, when the locators (i.e. id / xpath/ css selectors etc) we mentioned in the code is unable to find the web element
        on the web page.
        2. There are two possibilities for getting this Exception, i.e. either we have provided a incorrect locator and trying to find the web element or we
        have provided correct locator, but the web element related to the locator is not available on the web page.
        3. We can handle this exception by wrapping fluent wait with  try-catch block
